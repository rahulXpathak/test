    "# Statistics Part 2 - Theoretical Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What is hypothesis testing in statistics?\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine whether there is enough evidence in a sample of data to infer that a certain condition is true for the entire population. It helps in making decisions based on data rather than assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. What is the null hypothesis, and how does it differ from the alternative hypothesis?\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: It represents the default assumption that there is no effect, no difference, or no relationship in the population.\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha)**: It contradicts the null hypothesis and represents the effect, difference, or relationship that we want to test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "H₀: The new drug has no effect on blood pressure.  \n",
    "H₁: The new drug significantly affects blood pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. What is the significance level in hypothesis testing, and why is it important?\n",
    "The significance level (denoted as **α**) is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. Common values are 0.05 (5%) or 0.01 (1%). A lower α reduces the risk of false positives but may increase false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. What does a P-value represent in hypothesis testing?\n",
    "The **P-value** measures the probability of obtaining a test result at least as extreme as the observed data, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Small P-value (≤ α)**: Strong evidence against H₀, leading to its rejection.\n",
    "- **Large P-value (> α)**: Weak evidence against H₀, so we fail to reject it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. How do you interpret the P-value in hypothesis testing?\n",
    "- **P-value ≤ 0.05**: Strong evidence against the null hypothesis → Reject H₀.\n",
    "- **P-value > 0.05**: Insufficient evidence to reject H₀ → Fail to reject H₀.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If a test results in **P = 0.03**, we reject H₀ at a 5% significance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. What are Type 1 and Type 2 errors in hypothesis testing?\n",
    "- **Type 1 Error (False Positive)**: Rejecting H₀ when it is actually true. (False alarm)\n",
    "- **Type 2 Error (False Negative)**: Failing to reject H₀ when it is actually false. (Missed detection)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "- Type 1: A healthy patient is diagnosed with a disease.\n",
    "- Type 2: A sick patient is not diagnosed with the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. What is the difference between a one-tailed and a two-tailed test in hypothesis testing?\n",
    "- **One-tailed test**: Tests if a parameter is **either greater or less** than a certain value (but not both).\n",
    "- **Two-tailed test**: Tests if a parameter is **different** (either greater or smaller) from a certain value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "- One-tailed: \"New medicine reduces blood pressure\" (only one direction).\n",
    "- Two-tailed: \"New medicine affects blood pressure\" (either increase or decrease).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. What is the Z-test, and when is it used in hypothesis testing?\n",
    "A **Z-test** is used to compare a sample mean to a known population mean when:\n",
    "1. The population variance is known.\n",
    "2. The sample size is large (n ≥ 30).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Comparing the average test scores of students to a national average.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. How do you calculate the Z-score, and what does it represent in hypothesis testing?\n",
    "The **Z-score** formula:  \n",
    "\\[Z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:  \n",
    "- \\( X \\) = sample mean  \n",
    "- \\( \\mu \\) = population mean  \n",
    "- \\( \\sigma \\) = population standard deviation  \n",
    "- \\( n \\) = sample size  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Z-score represents how many standard deviations the sample mean is from the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. What is the T-distribution, and when should it be used instead of the normal distribution?\n",
    "The **T-distribution** is similar to the normal distribution but is used when:\n",
    "1. The sample size is **small (n < 30)**.\n",
    "2. The population standard deviation is **unknown**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is more spread out than the normal distribution but approaches normal as sample size increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. What is the difference between a Z-test and a T-test?\n",
    "| Z-test | T-test |\n",
    "|--------|--------|\n",
    "| Used when population variance is **known**. | Used when population variance is **unknown**. |\n",
    "| Sample size is **large (n ≥ 30)**. | Sample size is **small (n < 30)**. |\n",
    "| Uses normal distribution. | Uses T-distribution. |\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12. What is a confidence interval, and how is it used to interpret statistical results?\n",
    "A **confidence interval (CI)** is a range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter. It is calculated as:\n",
    "\\[CI = \text{sample mean} \\pm (\text{critical value} \times \text{standard error})\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a 95% CI of [45, 55] means we are 95% confident that the population mean is between 45 and 55.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13. What is an ANOVA test, and what are its assumptions?\n",
    "**ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)** tests whether there are significant differences among multiple group means.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions of ANOVA:**  \n",
    "1. **Normality** – Data should be normally distributed.  \n",
    "2. **Independence** – Observations should be independent.  \n",
    "3. **Equal Variance (Homogeneity of variance)** – Variances in different groups should be similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14. What is the F-test, and how does it relate to hypothesis testing?\n",
    "The **F-test** is used to compare two variances and check if they are significantly different.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **H₀**: The variances are equal.\n",
    "- **H₁**: The variances are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula:\n",
    "\\[F = \\frac{\text{Variance of group 1}}{\text{Variance of group 2}}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "If \\( F \\) is significantly high or low, we reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14. What is the margin of error, and how does it affect the confidence interval?\n",
    "The margin of error (ME) quantifies uncertainty in a confidence interval. A larger sample size reduces ME, making the interval narrower and more precise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 15. How is Bayes' Theorem used in statistics, and what is its significance?\n",
    "Bayes' Theorem helps update probabilities based on new evidence. Formula:\n",
    "\n",

    "(\n",

    "It is used in spam filtering, medical diagnosis, and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 16. What is the Chi-square distribution, and when is it used?\n",
    "The Chi-square distribution is used to test relationships between categorical variables. It is used in:\n",
    "\n",
    "Chi-square goodness of fit test (checks if data fits expected distribution).\n",
    "Chi-square test for independence (tests if two categorical variables are related).\n",
    "## 17. What is an ANOVA test, and what are its assumptions?\n",
    "ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) compares means across multiple groups. Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is normally distributed.\n",
    "The groups have equal variance.\n",
    "The samples are independent.\n",
    "## 18. What are the different types of ANOVA tests?\n",
    "One-way ANOVA – Compares means across one independent variable.\n",
    "Two-way ANOVA – Compares means across two independent variables.\n",
    "Repeated Measures ANOVA – Compares means when the same subjects are tested multiple times.\n",
    "## 19. What is the F-test, and how does it relate to hypothesis testing?\n",
    "The F-test compares variances between two or more groups to test if they are significantly different. It is commonly used in ANOVA tests.\n",
